ViWa - Next Generation Firewall
---

# Advantages
- High-Performance & Optimal use of Network speed<br>
In the case of the traditional firewall, the network speed decreases as the number of security protocols and devices increase. This happens because the dedicated network speed does not reach its expected potential with the increase in security devices and services. But, with the next generation firewall, you can constantly achieve the potential throughput irrespective of the number of devices and security protocols.
- Easily to monitor & operate
- Multi-layered protection <br>
A traditional firewall can block access through ports (single layer protection), which proves insignificant in the complex and evolving landscape of data architecture. NGFW offers multi-layered protection by inspecting traffic from layer 2 to layer 7 and at the same time understanding the exact nature of data transfer. So if data transfer is within the limits of defined firewall policy, will be transferred else it will be blocked.
- Application-level security functions such as IDS and IPS <br>
An NGFW has added the level of application security functions such as intrusion detection systems aka IDS, and intrusion prevention systems aka IPS. These applications help you to improve packet-content filtering. These features can also identify, analyse and act against irregular deviations from the standard set of activities, threat signatures and intelligent attacks based on user behaviour.
- Single console access<br>
A new generation firewall can be easily accessed from a single console, unlike the case of the traditional firewall where you need to set up and individually configure the firewall manually.
- Capability to implement Role-based Access <br>
New generation firewalls have an inherent ability to detect user identity. It can also work with different user roles and limit the scope of access for an individual and/or group. This feature helps the organizations to set role-based access to certain portions of their data and its content. Organizations can also make some of their data public and keep the rest of the confidential data with themselves.
