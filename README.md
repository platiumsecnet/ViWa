ViWa - Next Generation Firewall
---

# Advantages
- High-Performance & Optimal use of Network speed
In the case of the traditional firewall, the network speed decreases as the number of security protocols and devices increase. This happens because the dedicated network speed does not reach its expected potential with the increase in security devices and services. But, with the next generation firewall, you can constantly achieve the potential throughput irrespective of the number of devices and security protocols.
- High Secure
- Easily to monitor & operate
- Multi-layered protection
A traditional firewall can block access through ports (single layer protection), which proves insignificant in the complex and evolving landscape of data architecture. NGFW offers multi-layered protection by inspecting traffic from layer 2 to layer 7 and at the same time understanding the exact nature of data transfer. So if data transfer is within the limits of defined firewall policy, will be transferred else it will be blocked.
